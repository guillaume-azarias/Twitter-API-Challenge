# Analysis of Donald Trump Twitter activity

Donald John Trump, the 45<sup>th</sup> president of the United States, has pioneered the use of social media for political communication in an unprecedent way. The political and socio-economical consequences of his tweets have, at least in part, shaped the history of USA, with impacts reaching over a million of dollars for certain companies (check this comprehensive [article](https://www.fxcm.com/uk/insights/president-trumps-twitter-impact-forex-markets-stocks/) for more information).

Here, we use the Twitter API and Data Visualization tools to show essential features of Donald Trump's Twitter activity between December 2019 and February 2020:

    - Time course of Tweet activity over weekday and daily hours
    - Historical reasons of outstanding tweet activity
    - Linguistic analysis of tweets
    - Average number of retweets (~16 000 times per tweet)
    - Most active retweeters of Donald Trump's tweets

This work was prepared and presented together with my colleague [Andrea Festanti](https://github.com/afestant) at the [Propulsion Academy](https://propulsion.academy/), batch DS 2020 02 :metal:
